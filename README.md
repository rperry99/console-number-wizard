### This is a game based on a course I took on Udemy. I am doing a JavaScript version of it

- You pick a number between x and y, and the game will guess a number, you say if it's lower or higher, and eventually, the computer will get it right.

# Version 1

- Choose a random number between 1 and 1000 and the game will eventually guess it
- The first guess is a randomized number
- Eventually, the game will get it right, and once it does, you can play again.

### Version 1.1

- Fixed a bug where the game won't go up to 1000
